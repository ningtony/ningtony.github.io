						<h2>About Rui...</h2>
						<h2>Thank you for visiting my website.</h2>
						<p>I am a Registered Social worker, psychotherapist with over 15 years of experience working in community and health care setting helping individuals, couples and families adapt and make adjustments to their life in Canada.</p>
						<br />
						<p>I am passionate about working collaboratively with you to facilitate positive change and emotional growth and ultimately find your own happiness and joy in life. I believe that each individual already has the wisdom and knowledge needed for their own well-being and healing. My role as a therapist is to act as a guide along this journey and provide the tools for you to work with.  I'll work with you to understand the challenges and difficulties you face, explore your strengths, and help you develop strategies to address issues such as stress, depression, anxiety, relationship and family problems, self-esteem, and many of the transitions we face at all stages of our lives. I also help family members manage and cope with the complex emotions of caring for relatives with mental and physical health problems. My clinical practices reflect core principles of a trauma informed approach to care, using individuals’ strengths to empower them in the development or their treatment plan.  Everyone deserves to feel appreciated and accepted, and I can’t wait to work with you to achieve that goal!</p>
						<br />
						<p>“The journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.” Please contact me if you think you are ready to work through these life challenges and let me walk with you.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Individual therapy</a></h3>
								<p>I meet with individuals to learn about their negative thoughts and feelings, as well as the harmful or self-destructive behaviors that might accompany them. I help them to understand the underlying causes of their current problems (such as unhealthy relationship patterns or a traumatic experience from your past), with a focus on making positive changes in the present.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Couples therapy (marriage counseling)</a></h3>
								<p>I meet couples who want to reignite the flames in their relationship or heal painful wounds. I help them deepen their understanding of each other so each partner can provide a sense of security, protection, and comfort for the other, and can be available to support their partner in creating a positive sense of self and the ability to effectively regulate their own emotions, communicate better and problem-solve challenges in their relationship.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Family therapy</a></h3>
								<p>I meet with more than one member of the family at the same time to help the family resolve conflicts and improve interactions. Family therapy sessions can teach you skills to deepen family connections and get through stressful times, even after you're done going to therapy sessions. I offer parenting skills training.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Group therapy</a></h3>
								<p>I run psychoeducation and therapy groups which involves a group of peers working on the same problem, such as anxiety, depression, insomnia, grief and pain. Many people find attending group therapy is helpful as it can be a valuable place to practice social dynamics in a safe environment and find inspiration and ideas from peers who are struggling with the same issues.</p>

								<h3><a href="#">Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia （CBT-I)</a></h3>
								<p>If you find it difficult to fall asleep, wake up often in the middle of the night, take a long time to fall asleep again, and feel tired, irritable or drowsy during the day and find it difficult to sleep well, you may have insomnia.
									The treatment of insomnia disorder mainly includes drug therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. Drug therapy has many adverse reactions and is prone to addiction. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is the first choice for the treatment of chronic insomnia.
